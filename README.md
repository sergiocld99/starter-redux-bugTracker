# Simple Bug Tracker
A starter project to understand how Redux library works, and then migrate to standard code using Redux Toolkit. 
Firstly, JavaScript along Webpack was used for a quick implementation. 
After that, JS source files were replaced by its TypeScript translation.
Finally, a whole React project from Scratch was added, which calls the Redux Store using the defined Actions.
